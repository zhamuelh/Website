```{R}
library(reticulate)
py_config()
Sys.setenv(Reticulate_Python = "C:/Users/shigg/AppData/Local/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate/python.exe")
use_python("C:/Users/shigg/AppData/Local/r-miniconda/envs/r-reticulate/python.exe")

conda_create("r-reticulate")
use_condaenv("r-reticulate")
py_install("pandas")
```

#### 'Reticulate' is an R package that allows you to call python from R. Doing so will allow you to work with R and python interchangeably within RStudio's R Markdown feature. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd
ab = pd.read_csv(r'\Users\shigg\OneDrive\Documents\College Notes\PyRe\Data sets\abalone_original.csv')
ab = ab[['sex','rings']]
print(ab)
```

#### The chunk above is an example of a python chunk, and as you can see, is written in python syntax. Here, I import pandas from python and read in data set that contains the features and measurements of a sample of abalones (sea snails basically).

#### The chunk below is an R chunk. You may notice that there's a 'py$' in front of the variable we created above in the python chunk. In an R chunk, you can call variables created in a python chunk with py$ before the variable. Likewise, if you want to call a variable created in a R chunk into a python chunk, then the syntax would be 'r.' before the variable (for example, r.ab). 

```{R}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(py$ab, aes(x = sex, y = rings, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")

```
