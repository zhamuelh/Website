      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <description>IntroductionThe datasets I have chosen for this project are DMepi and pr, which are both found within the epi package in R. Both datasets contain variables related to the onset of diabetes in a Danish population. Pr is specialized towards diabetes prevalence in Denmark and contains variables such as age, sex, population size, and number of diabetes patients. DMepi contains more of the same as pr, however it differs in that it has variables related to mortality and person-years, with and without the diabetes condition.</description>

      <description>AbstractFor this project, I wanted to look at Covid-19 cases over time for a few Texas counties and compare them through data visualization. I wanted to know which counties are experiencing a high number of cases and which counties are experiencing a low number of cases. Cases are ultimately dependent on the number of testing that’s done. What I found was that some counties are not on the same page in terms of cases reported.</description>
